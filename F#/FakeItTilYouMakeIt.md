#FAKE it till you MAKE it
  Fake (F# Make) is a domain-specific language, written in F#, to help developers easily automate build tasks in the .NET stack.
  We'll look at scripting common build and deployment tasks using FAKE, from cleaning build directories to setting up and deploying to a local IIS site. Don't speak F#? No worries! FAKE provides a clear domain-specific language to work with so no experienced required. However it is a great way to dip your toes in the F# water, even in an enterprise! Come join and explore a .NET world where build scripts can be both easy to read and checked into source control.
