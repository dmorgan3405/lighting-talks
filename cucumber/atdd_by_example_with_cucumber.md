# ACCEPTANCE TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT BY EXAMPLE WITH CUCUMBER

##Abstract

Are you a developer or tester who wants to help prevent bugs instead of finding them? Have you heard of Cucumber and wonder what it was? Then this session is for you! Automated testing is taking over the software industry, however writing tests after development is done only is the start of it. When developers, qa, and business owners kick start features by creating and automating test cases together, the team gets the added benefit of building the right functionality. This hands on workshop will have attendees working through examples using ruby gems, such as Cucumber, Watir, and PageObject, and will cover core concepts such as creating automatable acceptance criteria, how to keep your test suite clean, and interacting with web browsers and other media types. Walking away with working examples and references, each attendee will leave with the ability to further build on the topics covered.
