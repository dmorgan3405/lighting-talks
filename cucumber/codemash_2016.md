##Abstract

Are you a developer or tester who wants to help prevent bugs instead of finding them?  Have you heard of (ATDD || Cucumber) and wonder what it meant? Then this session is for you! Automated testing is taking over the software industry, however writing tests after the development has been completed is only giving you part of the benefit.
When developers, qa, and business owners start features off by collaborating on creating and automating test cases, an the team gets the added benefit of focusing on building the right functionality. This hands on workshop will have attendees working through examples using ruby gems, such as Cucumber, Watir, and PageObject, and will cover core concepts such as creating automatable acceptance criteria, interacting with web browsers and other media types, and how to keep your test suite clean. Walking away with working examples and references, each attendee will leave with the ability to further to build on the topics covered.
