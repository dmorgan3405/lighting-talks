# Self-Organization
	* Influence: do not try to direct or control. 
	* Support team success over individual performance

Container - the boundary that a team operates within (space/organization/etc)
	
Differecnes - technical/domain/experience between team members
	* amplify or disfuse them
	* ask hard questions and then expect the team to solve them

Exchanges - between team members
	* insert new exchanges or people (process or people to encourage interactions and conversations)

# Empowerment
	* Engage
	* Ask for insights
	* Respect Insights
	* Having a prioritized list of request versus directives. (WHY are we building things, not just what.)

	* Does the team feel they like have had a choice in all aspects of agile adoption? (ie. were processes pushed to heavily on the team)
	* Would discussing decisions again help the team feel more empowered? (ie. pairing all day/ everyday, )
	* Has the team been able to discuss these with their manager?


# Autonomy
	* Does trust exist between everyone on the team?

	* Does working from home provide a greater sense of autonomy?

	* Will greater autonomy encourage more self-organization through empowerment?
